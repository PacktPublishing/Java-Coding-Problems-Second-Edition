# Checking if two text blocks are isomorphic
Write a program that checks if two text blocks are isomorphic. Two strings are considered isomorphic if we can map every character of the first string to every character of the second string in a one-to-one fashion (for instance, "xxyznnxiz" and "aavurraqu" are isomorphic).
