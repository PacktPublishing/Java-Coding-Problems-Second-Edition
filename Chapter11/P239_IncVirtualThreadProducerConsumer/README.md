# Solving the producer-consumer problem via virtual threads (increase/decrease consumers):
Refactor the producer-consumer problem developed in Java Coding Problems, First Edition, Chapter 10, Problem 204 to use virtual threads and Semaphore instead of newCachedThreadPool().If you don’t have that book then just give your own idea and implementation or simply follow the code from https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Java-Coding-Problems/tree/master/Chapter10.
